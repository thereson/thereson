ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Chukwuebuka Gerard Okolie â€” a Full-Stack Developer with strong experience in DevOps and Cloud Engineering.

I started my coding journey three years ago and have since specialized in building scalable applications and architecting cloud-native solutions. My experience spans across backend development, cloud infrastructure, and CI/CD automation, working with tools like AWS, Docker, Kubernetes, Terraform, Ansible, Jenkins, and GitHub Actions.

Currently, I work at OpenProduct, where I design and deploy cloud solutions, leveraging Terraform, Python (AWS Lambda), and EKS to deliver reliable and secure systems.

Previously, Iâ€™ve freelanced and collaborated on diverse projects including:

A flight booking platform

A CRM social media management tool

A health and lifestyle recommendation app

Iâ€™m passionate about automation, cloud-native architectures, and delivering production-ready solutions that blend efficiency with innovation.

ðŸ’¡ Tech I enjoy working with:

Languages: Python, JavaScript, C

Frontend: Vue.js, TailwindCSS

Backend: Node.js, REST APIs

DevOps & Cloud: AWS, Docker, Kubernetes, Helm, Terraform, Ansible, Prometheus
